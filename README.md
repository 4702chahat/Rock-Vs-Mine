# Rock-Vs-Mine Prediction


A sonar rock vs mine predictive system using logistic regression aims to classify sonar signals as either coming from rocks or mines (metal cylinders). Here's a step-by-step outline to build such a system:

1. Data Collection
Obtain a dataset that contains sonar signal returns (e.g., the UCI Machine Learning Repository has a "Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks" dataset).
The dataset typically consists of several features (frequency bands) and a label indicating whether the sonar return is from a rock or a mine.
2. Data Preprocessing
Load Data: Read the dataset into a data frame.
Normalize Data: Normalize the features for better performance of the logistic regression model.
Label Encoding: Convert categorical labels (rock, mine) into numerical values (0, 1).
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualization: Use histograms, pair plots, and other visualization techniques to understand the distribution of features.
Correlation Analysis: Check the correlation between features to see if there are any highly correlated or redundant features.
4. Model Building
Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets.
Logistic Regression Model: Initialize and train a logistic regression model using the training data.
5. Model Training
Fit Model: Use the training data to fit the logistic regression model.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like cross-validation to find the best model parameters.
6. Model Evaluation
Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data.
Performance Metrics: Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy score.
